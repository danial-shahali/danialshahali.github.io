          My name is Danial, I moved to
          <span style="color: blue">New Zealand</span> in 2009 from
          <span style="color: red">China</span>. I am a Systems Analyst at Air
          New Zealand I've been doing this job for the last 10 years. My
          day-to-day is to ensure the Operational Applications are running, and
          if there is an issue, I need to analyse and resolve the problem within
          a given time frame, or we will go back to the paperwork base.
          Therefore, the stress level is high but rewarding at the same time. I
          have always been interested in development work, but never given a
          chance due to required skill sets. A colleague of mine who was a
          graduate of Dev Academy encouraged me to give it a go, and I have attempted to
          enrol a couple of times, but the work commitment did not allow it, and
          then the pandemic happened. Finally, I decided to go for it at any
          cost, and thankfully, my employer agreed to give me 17 weeks off to do
          this then, upon my return, I will start taking on the development jobs in
          my chapter. So, here we go…
