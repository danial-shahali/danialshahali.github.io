        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.<br />
        <span style="color: blue"
          >Growing up in different countries has its goods and the downside side
          of things. The good thing is that you learn how to respect diversity
          and appreciate other cultures. That improved my lifestyle and allowed
          me to learn how to be adaptable. The downside of it would be having no
          long-term friends and keep making a new one until you are afraid to
          look for one… I had a choice to be an international student or a
          foreigner to work there, but that limited me in different aspects. For
          instance, when I moved to China, I had a tough time doing a simple
          task at work, as I had no help from a local translator! At first, I
          tried to change my colleagues’ working mentality that was a huge
          failure. So I had to make an ethical decision to change my way of work
          and learn their culture, their language. I put in extra effort after
          an hour, which led my colleague to approach and help me to learn
          better and help me to do my work. I kept that attitude of adaptability
          and built on it wherever I went, and that helped me to grow as a
          person and a professional.</span

        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.<br />

        <span style="color: blue"
          >I grew up in a diverse society for my entire life, People around me
          had a great influence on the person I am today, and I learned to
          appreciate life no matter what and be responsible for it even if I am
          in an awkward situation that I did not influence in at all, but this
          is my life and my responsibility to take action regardless. And that
          is one of the main reasons I am here at Dev Academy</span

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.<br />

        <span style="color: blue"
          >Determination is one of my strengths in life, and that never let me
          down. I had to learn different languages to communicate with people
          and learn new cultures to live with different people, which I relied
          on in my studies to be a software developer. It is not entirely easy
          to stop what you do and start something new, in my case, I am in
          technology, and I do like my job very much, but being a developer is
          what I want to be so that I can reach my long term career goal, Hence,
          the desire of being one, helped me to make this decision to pause life
          for a bit and take on this course.</span

        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        <br />

        <span style="color: blue"
          >My greatest limitation is my desire to know everything and be good at
          my work. Technology is a fast-paced and broad industry, and that is
          where I get frustrated and impacts my work. I might get to the stage
          where there is much to learn, and I have not accomplished what I
          planned for, and that is when things start to slow down, and I might
          need assistance.</span

      </li>
      <li>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

        <span style="color: blue"
          >I had a colleague who was quite knowledgeable but needed more
          experience. I had a challenge working with him as my colleague was not
          keen to change and formulate his working ethic that suited the team
          best. So, there needed to be more transparent communication on what
          was done and what was not, and that impacted the work delivery. I was
          diminished due to my lack of technical education back then by him and
          was called stupid several times. I was even accused of throwing
          hurdles and not letting my colleague do the work. The situation
          escalated, and we were called to HR. Then, we were assigned a mutual
          buddy to help us communicate, as I understand the business processes
          better, and he has the technical understanding, and we must merge to
          succeed. The middle person has formed our way of communication, and
          that lets us start talking directly without fighting. We improved our
          relationship and understood that my colleague thought I was getting
          credit for the work. At the same time, I intended to stand up for him
          and speak out for the job that was done, where we could have
          communicated more about it. I have learned a valuable lesson: if there
          is a conflict, attack the argument, not the person, and have a simple
          conversation to understand the situation before jumping to a
          conclusion and act.
