        What is Emotional Intelligence? <br /><span style="color: blue"
          >EQ is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express oneâ€™s
          emotions and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and
          empathically. People with emotional intelligence traits are
          empathetic, tuned in, and perceptive. They have high levels of
          emotional awareness, self-control, and situational skills. These
          emotional intelligence traits help them perceive, understand, use, and
          manage emotions in their personal lives, careers, and other
          situations. The 5 key elements of EI are; self-awareness and
          regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.

        How is EQ different to IQ?<br /><span style="color: blue"
          >IQ is your intellectual abilities that measure your ability to solve
          problems and think logically, and EQ measures your ability to
          understand and manage emotions. Your EQ can have a greater influence
          on your success in life than your IQ.

        Why is EQ important?<br /><span style="color: blue"
          >EQ is the ability to identify and regulate one's emotions and
          understand the emotions of others. A high EQ helps you to build
          relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job
          satisfaction. Some people say that your IQ can land you a job, but it
          is the lack of EQ and social intelligence in you that will make you
          lose a job. It is believed that your IQ accounts for only 20% of your
          success in life and 80% of your EQ. EQ is important because it can
          help you improve your interpersonal relationships, both personally and
          professionally.
