        Blocked on a simple problem<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          The Kata 3, the superFizzBuzz was quite a challenge, and at times, I
          found myself not even understanding what the requirements are! I used
          the robber duck method and Pseudocoded each line to get a better
          understanding of what I was doing. I felt the logic was right but did
          not generate the expected output. Hence, I reachout to my best friend,
          Google and searched about array methods and updating arrays, funtions
          and that helped me to realise that I was not calling the fizzbuss
          function correctly.

        Elegantly solved a problem<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          It was the Kata 4 the Stretch Challenge. I wrote the code in Edge
          Console generated the output and then updated it in the challenge.

        How confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes

          <p style="color: blue">
            Pseudocode is a great tool. It helps me reflect on what I did and
            how I did it. Writing down the problem statement, and how to resolve
            it, and what action is needed to resolve it is a kind of practice I
            appreciate and are comfortable to use.

            I normally think loud, and I found it quite useful when deep in my
            thoughts. It helped me quite abit in Kata 4 and 5.

            Reading the error messages is something that I do at work daily.
            This is the only way for us to understand the issue. I have used
            this method to debug my code.

            For almost all the challenges, I have used the console.logging to

            Google is my best buddy when it comes to searching and learning. I
            have used Google for all JS Methods to have a better understanding

            I asked for help when isolated from all other resources, and this
            was a good way of learning peers' understanding.

            Coaches are pretty helpful. And I had a scenario that asked for help
            in Discord, and one of the coaches replied with directions. I will
            ask for help if it is needed during the boot camp.

        A time you were reluctant to ask for help<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I am not shy to ask for help when all my options are isolated. And
          when asking for help, I include what I have done and what was the
          result to assist being helped and improve my understanding.
