        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
        <br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt due to
          experience. It is the brain's ability to change, reorganise, or grow
          neural networks. This can involve functional changes due to brain
          damage, that is, the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged
          brain area to other undamaged areas, or Structural changes due to
          learning that is the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged
          brain area to other undamaged areas. Plasticity refers to the brain's
          malleability or ability to change. Neuro refers to neurons, the nerve
          cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system.
          Thus, neuroplasticity allows nerve cells to change or adjust.
          Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt and change to help promote;
          the ability to learn new things, to enhance existing cognitive
          capabilities, recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries,
          strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined and
          improvements that can boost brain fitness.

      <li>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Having a growth mindset means believing that a person's abilities
          aren't innate but can be improved through effort, learning, and
          persistence. A growth mindset is all about the attitude with which a
          person faces challenges, how they process failures, and how they adapt
          and evolve as a result. Our talents can be developed by hard work,
          good strategies, others' involvement and learning from them, and that
          will increase our resilience when challenged and help in continuous
          improvement.

      <li>
        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Trying new experiences, constantly learning, staying physically
          active, and creating stimulating environments will improve
          neuroplasticity. Playing puzzle games, learning a new language,
          travelling and drawing or writing a journal contribute to improving
          neuroplasticity.

        <p style="color: blue">
          Going through this topic helped me understand my own mindset better.
          Growing up in different countries was a huge challenge, and I had to
          learn new things, adapt to new experiences and, which at the time was
          challenging. Lately, I started to doubt myself when I see my peers
          flying through the course, and I am behind. However, I spent some time
          reading more about how to change your mindset and aligned that with my
          own way of doing things, and I started to understand better and be
          more agile.

      <li>
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I think the best approach for me is to keep challenging myself and
          even take a positive point out of failure. Stop doubting myself and my
          understanding. And if you struggle, then ask for help and go deeper
          into negativity. It is okay to lose, but it is not okay to repeat the
          wrong and keep losing. But learn and improve and move forward.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          To look after my well-being, keep doing regular exercises and take
          sufficient time to sleep to recharge. Take a walk if out of my depth
          or struggle with understanding a topic and return to it, and if it is
          still an issue, take notes of my understanding and approach my peers
          or couches for advice. It is not a doubt how many times or how hard we
          fail. What matters is we get up and move forward. Even if we know that
          we might fail, it does not mean to stop doing the right thing and
          taking on this course if the right path for my career, well-being and
          progress.
