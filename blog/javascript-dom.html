          HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Dog. The HTML represents the body. His four
          legs, ears, eyes, tails etc. The CSS represents the look. The coating
          and the eye color, size, shape of his head, ears, nose, teeth, etc.
          The JavaScript represents how the dog behaves. When he sees a
          stranger, he barks; when hungry, he barks; when in pain, he is quiet
          and following you everywhere. When you tell him to sit, run, or roll,
          he obeys your command, and when you put his food in front of him, he
          looks at you until you signal him to do it. , etc. HTML is the
          structure of a website, while CSS beautify the page, and JavaScript
          controls the behaviour of the webpage.

        Control Flow and Loops<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Imagine reading a news page in the newspaper. We need to understand
          the context of the paper; to do that, we need to read from left to
          right, top to bottom, to understand it. This is how a computer
          understands a bunch of lines of code. Read it line by line and action.
          This action is called
          <span style="color: black">Control Flow</span>, the order in which
          statements are executed in a program. The default control flow is for
          statements to be read and executed in a program file from left to
          right, top to bottom. <span style="color: black">Loop</span> is used
          to perform a repeated action based on its condition. And it will carry
          on until it meets the condition. It is like adding milk and sugar to
          the coffee or tea. You add and taste until it tastes as you like it,
          then stop and start enjoying your coffee.

        What is DOM<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser
          window or as an HTML source. It is the same document in both cases.
          Still, the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be
          manipulated, and it can be modified with a scripting language such as
          JavaScript. As it is generally not recommended to mix the structure of
          the page (written in HTML) and manipulation of the DOM (written in
          JavaScript), the JavaScript parts will be grouped together here, and
          separated from the HTML. For example, the following function creates a
          new h1 element, adds text to that element, and then adds it to the
          tree for the document:<br />
          <img src="../images/DOM.png" alt="DOM Image" />
        </p>
      </li>

        Accessing data from arrays and objects<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          An Array is a collection of data and a data structure that is stored
          in a sequence of memory locations. One can access the elements of an
          array by calling the index number such as 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦, etc. The
          array can store data types like Integer, Float, String, and Boolean
          all the primitive data types can be stored in an array. The object can
          contain anything in the real world such as person names, cars, and
          game characters. Objects are very easy to use in some situations if
          you know where the data is being processed. The character set of
          objects is known as Properties. The properties of an object can be
          called by using DOT notation and [] notation.<br />

        What functions are and why they are helpful<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          The Functions are the basic building block of JavaScript. Functions
          allow us to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it multiple times.
          Functions make JavaScript code more readable, organized, reusable, and
          maintainable. With using functions, we can re-execute blocks of code
          when we are writing programs, without having to re-write the block of
          code entirely. We need a way of grouping code together and giving it a
          name, so that we can call it by that name later, and that's what we
          call a function.
