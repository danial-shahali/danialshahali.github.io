        What is Te Whare Tapa Whā<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Te Whare Tapa Whā is an holistic model of health that describes health
          as a wharenui/meeting house with four walls. These walls represent
          taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing), taha hinengaro (mental and
          emotional wellbeing), taha tinana (physical wellbeing) and taha whānau
          (family and social wellbeing).

      <li>
        Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          After recovering from a chronic injury, I started to get back to play
          football again. But being unfit, I go to the gym at least 3 times a
          week and run 3 times a week early in the morning.

      <li>
        Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Technology makes contacting friends and family easier, but I prefer
          face-to-face interactions. My parents live in Auckland, and we pay a
          visit once a week, and daily video calls to check on them.

      <li>
        Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Recently, I started to meditate, and it helps me not to go 500 miles
          an hour, take things at a time and be more focused. I intend to do
          that daily before going to bed and practice breathing to relax my head
          before bed.

      <li>
        Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I pray daily in the morning when walking my pooch.

        Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I enjoy walking barefooted since moved to New Zealand and when the
          weather allows, I do that.
