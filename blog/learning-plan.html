      <li>
        What is your long term goal or career pathway. <br />
        <p style="color: blue">To be a solution architect in 5 years’ time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
        <br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          Determination is my core strength, as I've been told, and my
          limitation is the desire to learn many things at once and doubting my
          knowledge that will be overwhelming and lead to failure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I want to be able to communicate clearly about what is in my head and
          not be afraid to speak about my thoughts even if I am not on the right
          path.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
        <dd>
          <li>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives.
          </li>

          <p style="color: blue">
            I’ve taken 17 weeks off to commit to this and be available full-time
            to achieve my goals. My idea of success is to commit 40 hours to
            accomplish your work as instructed, commit 60 to learn and practice
            more so you can make a difference, and commit 80 to be exceptional
            by learning new things and applying them. So, besides 6 hours of
            sleep and 6 hours of family/personal time, I’ll be doing my best to
            practice and learn for the remaining hours of the day. I will
            communicate as regularly as possible about my whereabouts, what I am
            working on, what I need help with, and also what I can help to
            improve my learning abilities and become competent as a software
            developer.

            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you.

        <dd>
          <p style="color: blue">
            I will take a step back to get a bigger picture of the situation,
            note what has been done and try to understand what went wrong. If
            still not satisfied, then I’ll get in touch with my peers and
            facilitators to ask for help.

      <li>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I will do my best to communicate using the Discord channel, however,
          during the boot camp, I would rather face to face conversations using
          paper or whiteboard with my peers.

      <li>
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          My expectation is to show us the patch, the direction to go to and
          find the answer, and that is what I’ve been seeing so far.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.<br />
        <p style="color: blue">
          I use the 6 hours I planned daily to look after my personal matters.
          But, never overlook sudden facts like looking after a sick family
          member. Other than that, Dev Academy it is…
