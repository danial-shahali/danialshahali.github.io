      <h1>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h1>

    <p class="p-style">
      In simple English, imagine that we are in an sport event in a stadium with
      rows of seats. All spectators with an inline seated , will sit next to
      eachother. so we all have the same seat, we cannot make those sits larger
      or smaller! They have one size. This is
      <span style="color: rgb(149, 0, 255)">inline</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p-style">
      Some people may know each other, and they are in VIP seats. These are
      customized and can be adjusted to be larger or smaller. These seats might
      be at the same row with fixed seats but with extras. This is
      <span style="color: rgb(149, 0, 255)">inline-block</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p-style">
      Some seats are special seats, and they have their unique rows, like seats
      for disable people, they are standard seats but they have their own
      specific area and blocked from the crowd. This is
      <span style="color: rgb(149, 0, 255)">block</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <p class="p-style">
      The inline element can have right and left paddings and margins, but they
      cannot have top and bottom padding and margin. We cannot set width and
      height but other elements can be placed on its sides. Thers is no line
      break before or after but it can tolerates html elements next to it. As
      you can see in the image below, the both paragraph
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="../images/inline.png" alt="inline display" />

    <h3>Inline-Block Elements</h3>
    <p class="p-style">
      The inline-block element is similar to an inline element, but it behaves
      as a block element. That is it allows other elements to sit to the left
      and right of it, and accpet the the top and buttom paddings and margins.
      We can also, set height and width to an inline-block.
    </p>
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../images/inline-block.png"
      alt="inline-block display"
    />

    <h3>Block Elements</h3>
    <p class="p-style">
      The block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not
      tolerate any HTML elements next to it. It forces a line break after the
      block element acquires full-width if width not defined.
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="../images/block.png" alt="block display" />
